<!--
Hi there! Thanks for submitting an issue for drupal-docker-lite.

If you're filing a feature request please make sure that it _enhances current functionality_, and does not add completely new technologies onto the stack.

Good: The start.sh script should let you checkout an existing repository interactively

Not great: Add an Apache Solr image to docker-compose.yml
